# Openstax: Chemisty 2e

## Chapter 1: Essential Ideas

> So I've been wanting to do chemisty since my A levels started but I hated how it was formalized and instead of learning the subject I was forced to study for a test I did not care for. Now that my A level has ended I have the freedom to approach the subject how I've wanted to! And so that's what this is going to be :3

### 1.1 Chemistry in Context

1. Testing $\to$ Constant Observation $\to$ "Law".
2. Testing $\to$ Hypothisis Supported $\to$ "Theory", e.g: Kinetic Particle Theory.
3. Microscopic Domain $\to$ Smol.
4. Macroscopic Domain $\to$ Normal sized.
5. Symbolic Domain $\to$ Language used in chemisty to indicate parts of the microscopic and macroscopic domain, e.g: H$_{2}$O($l$).

### 1.2 Phases and Classification of Matter

1. Matter $\thickapprox$ Anything that occupies space and has mass $\thickapprox$ Volume and Mass.
2. ($s$)($l$)($g$) $\approx$ (solid)(liquid)(gas) $\to$ Most common forms of Matter on earth.
3. Mass $\approx$ amount of matter $\to$  $\approx$ measure of inertia $\to$ amount of force taken to accelerate object.
