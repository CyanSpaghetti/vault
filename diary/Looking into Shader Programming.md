#Diary 
As of writing it is the 19th of June.
Yesterday I took some time to look into [[Shader Programming]] and made some pretty cool stuff.
However, there's a lot of stuff about [[Shader Programming]] that I still don't know or understand.
So by starting this note I hope to expand my understanding of [[Shaders]].
[[GLSL]] is also really weird to write code in and I don't know how to implement stuff like [[2D Perlin Noise]] or anything! But I should get there soon.

I think it's quite cool!
