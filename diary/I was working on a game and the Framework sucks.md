#Diary 
I was working on a game to make in [[Macroquad]] and after like ages of work I find out it doesn't even support mixes [[2D]] and [[3D]]??! YOU CAN'T EVEN IMPORT [[3D Models]]!! GRAAAAAA
Anyway, so while looking for [[Rust]] [[Framework]]s that support [[2.5D]] stuff I finally landed on the same shit I decided I didn't wanna use at the start: [[Raylib]]!
To learn [[Raylib]] I need experience with the [[Framework]] which means I need to make a [[Video Game]] using it. I tried to look for super quick [[Game Jam]]s going on at the moment and I found the "[[Monochromatic]] [[Game Jam]] 2"!
For this I've been inspired to work with as many constraints as possible so I can use my [[Creativity]] and [[Engineering]] without taking 5 years making something no one cares about or want to play!
So with this I've decided my first constraint is for the art: Everything has to be [[Monochromatic]]. And secondly, inspired by [[The Missus]], I'm going to use a loose interpretation of a [[Literary Device]] to come up with a game.
I think it's a pretty good [[Idea]] considering what the fuck the original issue at hand was. Let's work on this till I fucking die tonight I guess.
Step 1 is to learn about [[Literary Device]]s, so I'm gonna make that obsidian page next :3

It is now the 23rd of June, and I've finally had an idea for my game that sounds cool enough to make. Fuck the other stuff I said, I want to make a game with synergies! I feel like a tower defense game with the same theme as something like [[Midinous]]!
I think we start with a map, mouse movement, block placement, then some ping blocks, node connection, enemy entities, shooting blocks, and see how it looks and add more stuff based off of that. Enemies and Weapons must be a problem and a solution. Something like [[Balatro]] has a LOT of strategies you can add to play, so I want something like that.
