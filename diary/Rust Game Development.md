So turns out, [[Rust]] [[Game Development]] is actually kinda cool!
I just don't know rust well enough to be able to write useful code, like UI and stuff.
Which means I will have to learn it again. The [No Boilerplate](http://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) guy said he attempted to get into it like thrice before he understood what he was learning or doing, so something like that might apply here. I'm not particularly good at [[Computer Science]] stuff, it's more of a hobby than an obsession, although there are times when I can't control my excitement for some topics.
I've put a lot of effort into [[Python]] but it's libraries and their specifications are much harder to get into than the language itself for me. At least from what I've seen, [[Rust]] does this better which it's built in standardization for code.
Also people keep saying that rust is ugly as fuck but like I disagree, [[C++]] is ugly as fuck:
`
`fn main() {`
    `println!("sup");`
`}`
``
Does more for me than:
``
`include <iostream>`
`int main() {`
    `std::cout << "sup" << std::endl;`
    `return 0;`
`}`

But anyway, I don't remember enough [[C++]] and don't know enough [[Rust]] to share a worthwhile opinion :3

Since I started this thingie, I think I've learned more [[Rust]] but more or less all of my opinions remain the same. Fighting against the [[Compiler]] is a pain in the ass, but the code it produces feels very slick and clean â€” It's a new feeling compared to the ugly and disgusting spaghetti code I've previously written in [[C#]] and [[Python]].
