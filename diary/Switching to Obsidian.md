After using [[Markdown]] in [[VSCode]]/[[VSCodium]]/[[Neovim]] with syncing done with git, I've decided to switch to using [[Obsidian (App)]] as my editor for the time being!
I've also decided that instead of keeping everything outside a folder I'm going to be having big folders that keep everything in order:
1. #Diary
2. #Learning 
3. #Other
4. #Inbox
5. #People
6. #Topics
This should — pretty consistently — keep everything in order the way I want it to! So I'm gonna be doing that now.
I also need to remember to update the paths in my gitignore file **before** updating anything. 
Probably the next step after this would be to keep adding diary entries while referencing material outside them like books and stuff and then making entries for those as well after reading them!
