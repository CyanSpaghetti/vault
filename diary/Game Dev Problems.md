#Diary
I've been wanting to make a [[Video Game]] again for a while again, but
[[Unity]] keeps on crashing and not working without explanation
[[Godot]] and [[Pygame]] I don't know well enough to make something in
[[Bevy]] and [[Rust]] are too complicated for me to get into at the moment.

But I __do__ want to make something! So the best bet for me at the moment is to either try and make unity work or just start learning [[Godot]] and [[Pygame]].
Which shall be an adventure!
