Yesterday I went to Readings with [[Hashim (Brother)]] and found some cool books to read:
1. [[A Clockwork Orange]] by [[Anthony Burgess]]
2. [[The Great Gatsby]] by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]
3. [[All Men are Mortal]] by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]
I started reading with [[A Clockwork Orange]] but because of how bad the data was, all the new slang words I wasn't able to look up onto my [[Phone]] and immediately got confused and put off.
I've already tried to read [[The Great Gatsby]] when we went to that [[Trip North]] but it found the book pretty boring.
However, [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s [[All Men are Moral]] had me HOOKED. I finally felt like I was in the space to be able to read again, although I had to force myself to focus for the slow start of the book.
