#Diary
While I was playing around with [[NixOS]] I decided to switch from [[Cinnamon]] to [[Hyprland]] and found a cool theme for it:
I was just trying to see how I can make the whole system a different theme!
And found a cool ass repo: https://github.com/MathisP75/hyppuccin.git

So far, the [[Waybar]] top bar is now set I feel like and the [[Kitty]] terminal.
[[Neovim]] keeps giving me dumbass problems!
I found this was from a [[Youtube]] video I saw that also gave me the idea for this repo :3
I feel like this is gonna be fun!!!
