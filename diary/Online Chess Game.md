#Diary
I had this idea in the last physics class I had when the Sir was yelling for no reason!
I was like hmm that [[Video Game]] I'm working on kinda sucks and I would like to make it better.
I haven't touched or opened that book in ages though.
I don't know how it's coming along.
I was like hmm ([[PvE]])vP which is a really cool.
A new concept that I don't think anyone has come up with and made a game using, probably because it isn't very practical.
