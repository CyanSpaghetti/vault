So yesterday I found out that the teacher who is supposed to teach us physics doesn't know how to teach (I knew this already) but he has also never finished the syllabus on time, ever (according to another teacher whom I shall not name).  

This means that to not fail, I will have to do the “learning” myself along with other kids. Physics isn't difficult by any means, which is the opposite of what the teacher will tell you.  

So what topics do I need to do to not fail the exam I have from the 25th?
Well, physics has 5 papers in total. The more difficult in my opinion is definitely the AS syllabus which consists of the following topics:

1. Uncertainties
2. Measurement
3. Kinematics
4. Dynamics
5. Forces
6. Work, Energy and Power
7. Momentum
8. Material Physics
9. Electric Current
10. Kirchhoff's Laws
11. Resistance and Resistivity
12. Practical Circuits
13. Waves
14. Superposition
15. Stationary Waves
16. Atomic Structure

Out of these topics, 3,4,5,6 and 7 I kind of know, but the rest are give or take.

Next, for A2 the syllabus is:

1. Circular Motion
2. Gravitational Fields
3. Oscillations
4. Thermal Physics
5. Ideal Gases
6. Uniform Electric Fields
7. Coulomb's Laws
8. Capacitance
9. Magnetic Fields and Electromagnetism
10. Motion of charged particles
11. Electromagnetic Induction
12. Alternating Currents
13. Quantum Physics
14. Nuclear Physics
15. Medical Imaging
16. Astronomy and Cosmology

I might be a bit fucked here because we've not covered a concerning amount of these topics in class, and the ones we did cover I don't understand because the guy doesn't know how to teach.
So what I'm thinking is that I should read these topics from the book first and foremost so that I at least have SOME understanding of them, as well as read the practical sections from the book.
I shall keep y'all updated as to what goes!
