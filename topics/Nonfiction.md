A genre of [[Literature]] that consists of anything that is NOT [[Fiction]].
The following are the types of Nonfiction books:
- [[Reference Works]]
- [[Life Writings]]
- [[Literary Criticism]]
- [[Persuasive Writing]]
- [[History Books]]
- [[Academic Texts]]
- [[News]]
- [[Textbooks]]
- [[Self-help Books]]
I feel like that's a pretty simple definition that gets the message across.
