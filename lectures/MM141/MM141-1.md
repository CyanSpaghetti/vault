- Grad Student
- Lab is for exercise along the MM101 course
- Fundamental to Technology and Innovation
- Metals:
	- Dense 
	- Good Conductors
	- Strong and Ductile
	- Can be shaped
	- e.g.: Aluminum, Iron, Copper
	- Applications: Construction, Automobiles, Electrical Wiring, Aserospace, etc.
- Ceramics:
	- Non-metialic Solids
	- Metal Oxides, Metal Carbides
	- Hard and Britttle
	- High Melting Point
	- Excellent thermal and Electrical insulators
	- e.g.: Alumina, Silicon carbide, Zirconia, Tungsten carbide, etc.
	- Applications: Cutting tools, aerospace, biomedical implants
- Polymers:]
	- Long chains of organic molecules made of repeating chains of monomers
	- Lightweight and flexible
	- Low strength compared to metals
	- Good corrosion resistance
	- e.g.: Polyethylene, Nylon, PVC, etc.
	- Applications: Packaging, Textiles, etc.
- Composites:
	- Made from combining two or more distinct materials
	- Tailored properties
	- Often stronger and lighter than individual components
	- Can be designed for specific use
	- e.g.: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, Fiberglass, etc.
	- Applications: Aircraft, sports equipment, automotive, wind turbine blades, etc.
- Modern Materials
	- Graphene:
		- Made from Graphite
		- High strength
		- Flexible
		- Strong
		- Carbon Nanotubes and Fullerene
	- Piezoelectric Materials
		- Respond to Mechanical Stress with Electric potential
		- Many uses 
		- e.g.: Quartz
	- Shape Memory Alloys
		- They remember their original shape
		- Robotics, Aerospace, Biomedical
		- Phase transformation (Low and High temperature)
		- Mardinsite structure is remembered
		- Ostinite is the deformed structure
	- Hydroxyapatite Bioceramic
		- Human Hard Tissue
		- Bioactive, Nontoxic
- Integrated Circuits
	- Fixed number of components to create a circuit
- Printed Circuit Boards
	- Made according needs using ICs and
