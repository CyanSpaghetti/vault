	- Hydrogen atom's brought together (inter-nuclear distance decreased) affects the potential energy of both atoms. The energy keeps going down until the lowest value. Going past the lowest value and still forcing them together leads to the energy increasing exponentially.

- Quizzes will have both practical application questions and straightforward questions on topics.
- Bond Length $\propto$ 1/Energy Needed
- When we go lower on the periodic table we get weaker bonds
- Types of Bonds
	- Primary (Inter-atomic) Bonds
		- Covalent Bonds
			- Sharing of Electrons
		- Ionic Bonds
			- Ceramic Materials usually have this bond
			- Giving/Taking of Electrons
		- Metallic Bonds
			- Need very low activation energy
			- Close to Ionic bond
		- Partial Covalent bonds
	- Secondary (Inter-molecular) Bonds
		- Hydrogen Bonds
			- Involves Hydrogen and an electronegative element
			- HCl is induced dipole
		- Van der Waal's force
			- Temporary (Induced) or permanent dipoles
		- Dispersion forces
- Bonds are a vector quantity (Excluding Ionic bonds)
- Induced Dipole: Partial charge because of movement of electron cloud
- DNA molecules have different types of bonds in them

- Solids can be Crystalline or Amorphous
- Quartz and Glass are both Silica but Crystalline and Amorphous, respectively.
- Copper is a crystalline metal. It has grains under a microscope. Different grains reflect light at different planes.
- Grains are blocks of crystals with atoms are the center. They are arranged in layers and layers.  
- ![[Formation of Crystals in Materials - Textbook.png]]
- This is called reduced sphere bonding. Atoms are not spheres they are represented as hard balls. In reality atoms are packed with minimal space between them (ABC packing, ABA packing, etc.)
- Nucleus: Central structure
- Grain Boundary is more energetic than the Grain Interiors
- Formation of Grains: ![[Formation of Grains in Materials - Textbook.png]]
- Poly-crystalline has Grains
- Single Crystal of Iron 
- Tin transform from one crystal from another undergoing 27% volume change. White Tin $\to$ Gray Tin.
- There are multiple crystal systems
	- We only need to worry about Cube and Hexagon
- BCC (Base Centered Cubic), FCC (Face Centered Cubic), HCP (Hexagon Closed Pack)
- Coordinate System for understanding crystal structure (x (in-out) y (right-left) z (up-down))
- How to locate:
	- Points ($0D$)
	- Directions ($1D$)
	- Planes ($2D$)
- Entirety of Tech industry is based off of Doping of Silicon Crystals
- To identify the positions of doping, the conventional coordinate system is used. e.g.:
  $q = \frac{1}{4}, r= 1, s=\frac{1}{2}$
  along $x, y, z = q, r, s$ in unit cell 
  $(z:0.4mm, x:0.48mm, y:0.46mm)$
  $(qx = 0.12, ry = 0.46, zs =0.2)$
- Callister set the standard with a $0\, 0\, 0$ standard instead of $(0,0,0)$
- $[\,\,]$ is for direction, $(\,\,)$ is for defining a plane
