- Physics vs. Chemistry
- Chapter 1 and 2 of the book of Callister is self study
- Material Science is the combination of Physics and Chemistry
- Solids, Atomic Bodies, Electron Behavior, Microscopy & Spectroscopy, Thermodynamics,
- Classification:
	- Metal $\to$ Ferrous, Non-Ferrous
	- Non-Metal $\to$ Ceramic (Metals reacted with nonmetals), Composites, Polymers (chains of carbon and hydrogen)
- We will look at the Structure, Properties, Characteristics, Performance, and Processing of Materials
- Hardness (A property of materials) $\to$ Plastic Deformation 
- Processing $\to$ Affects the properties and structure
- Quinching is putting a hot material into water
- Nanotechnology $\to$ $10^{-9}$ Nano-transistors 
- Silver is antibacterial in nature
- Size affects Optical Properties
- Surface-Area to Volume Ratio Affects Catalytic Activity
- Iron makes up 7% of the earth's crust
- Carbon mixes into Iron's crystal structure
- 6-weight-% of Steel (max) is carbon
- Low-Carbon, Medium-Carbon, High-Carbon are grades of steel
- Toughness $\to$ How much energy an object can absorb before it fracture
- Machine-able, Weldable
- Material Scientists are looking to make an alternative for Glass, Plastic, and Tin/Aluminium 
- Single Crystal $\to$ Visible, Porous $\to$ Opaque
- Human bone is a natural composite
- We design materials according to what material we want
