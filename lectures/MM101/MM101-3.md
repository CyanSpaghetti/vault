- Mechanical Properties of Materials:
	- Elasticity: ability of an object to maintain it's shape after being stretched or compressed. In metals Elasticity is on the atomic scale. Elastic Modulus is the measurement of Elasticity. 
	- Plasticity: Bonds never go back to their original position. The material permanently changes shape.
	- Strength: Many kinds.
	- Hardness: Property of a material to resist plastic deformation.
	- Brittleness: Do not show plastic deformation (Hard).
	- Ductility: Show a lot of plastic deformation (Soft).
	- Toughness: How much energy a material can absorb till the point of fracture.
	- Stiffness: Ability of a material to absorb energy till the elastic limit. Stronger resistance to deformation.
	- Resilience: ???
- Fracture-Toughness Trends:
	- Metals are tough and don't fracture easily and absorb a lot of energy.
	- Ceramics are very brittle 
	- Polymers are less brittle
	- Composites range a lot in their properties because they can be made according to our needs
- Conductivity:
	- Metals are conductive
	- Ceramics are insulators
	- Polymers are insulators 
	- Semiconductors only conduct under certain conditions
- Conductivity and Allotropic form of carbon:
	- Graphite and Graphene: Conductivity is a direction property
	- Diamond is a poor conductor 
	- Carbon Nanotube is very conductive
- Properties linked to structure
	- Atoms
		- Forces are being transferred from one atom to the other
		- Layers of atoms in metals slide against each other which leads to deformation
	- Molecules
	- Crystal
	- Micro and Macro
- Bond Length and Atom Interaction
	- Bonding is the interaction between atoms
	- Graph is a summation of repulsive and attractive forces
	- Potential energy is also a graph and goes down.
	- At 74 Picometers the wavefunctions (probability cloud) of two hydrogen atoms, according to newton's third law, stop in place. This phenomenon is the "bond." Their potential energy has a minimum point where this occurs.
	- $295\textdegree K$ is room temperature

- Definitely read the book.
