# Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy

So the book starts of with a bunch of Descartes.
It talks about **Cogito, ergo sum** and the **Thought Demon**.
He also mentions how Descartes was a catholic! Which I didn't know!!
It then talks about the weaknesses of Descartes' arguments.
And then it briefly mentions Nietzsche and another German guy.
Then it talks about Cogito some more then goes into Rationalism and Russel.

In this current reading, I'm already kind of tired so not much makes sense :(
