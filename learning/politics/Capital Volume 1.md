#### 1.0 Commodities and Money
##### 1.1  The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value
1. > *"The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities...”*
2. > *"A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference."*
3. > *"Exchange value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, a relation constantly changing with time and place."*
4. > *"In the same way the exchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity."*
5. > *"Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves, we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them, and the concrete forms of that labour; there is nothing left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour, human labour in the abstract."*
