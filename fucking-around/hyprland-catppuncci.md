I was just trying to see how I can make the whole system a different theme!
And found a cool ass repo: https://github.com/MathisP75/hyppuccin.git

So far, the waybar top bar is now set I feel like and the kitty terminal.
Neovim keeps giving me dumbass problems!
I found this was from a youtube video I saw that also gave me the idea for this repo :3
I feel like this is gonna be fun!!!
