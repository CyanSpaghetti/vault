# Rust Game Development 

So turns out, rust game dev is actually kinda cool!
I just don't know rust well enough to be able to write useful code, like UI and stuff.
Which means I will have to learn it again. The [No Boilerplate](http://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate) guy said he attempted to get into it like thrice before he understood what he was learning or doing, so something like that might apply here. I'm not particularly good at CS stuff, it's more of a hobby than an obsession although there are times when I can't control my excitement for some topics.
I've put a lot of effort into python but it's libraries and their specifications are much more harder to get into than the language itself for me. At least from what I've seen, rust does this better which it's built in standardization for code.
Also people keep saying that rust is ugly as fuck but like I disagree, C++ is ugly as fuck:
`
fn main() {
    println!("sup");
}
`
Does more for me than:
`
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "sup" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
`
But anyways, I don't remember enough C++ and don't know enough Rust to share a worthwhile opinion :3
